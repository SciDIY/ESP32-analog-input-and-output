In this tutorial, you’ll learn how analog input and analog output work on the ESP32 by building a simple and practical project using the Arduino IDE.

We’ll connect a potentiometer to the ESP32 to read analog input values and use PWM (analog output) to smoothly dim and brighten an LED. This project is perfect for beginners who want to understand how sensors and outputs work together in real-world ESP32 applications.
